Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

They are powerful but very expensive to train and use. The extremely high inference cost, in both time and memory, is a big bottleneck for adopting a powerful transformer for solving real-world tasks at scale.\\nWhy is it hard to run inference for large transformer models? Besides the increasing size of SoTA models, there are two main factors contributing to the inference challenge (Pope et al. 2022):\\n\\nLarge memory footprint. Both model parameters and intermediate states are needed in memory at inference time. For example,\\n\\nThe KV cache should be stored in memory during decoding time; E.g. For a batch size of 512 and context length of 2048, the KV cache totals 3TB, that is 3x the model size (!).\\nInference cost from the attention mechanism scales quadratically with input sequence length.\\n\\n\\nLow parallelizability. Inference generation is executed in an autoregressive fashion, making the decoding process hard to parallel.\\n\\nIn this post, we will look into several approaches for making transformer inference more efficient. Some are general network compression methods, while others are specific to transformer architecture.\\nMethods Overview#\\nWe in general consider the following as goals for model inference optimization:\\n\\nReduce the memory footprint of the model by using fewer GPU devices and less GPU memory;\\nReduce the desired computation complexity by lowering the number of FLOPs needed;\\nReduce the inference latency and make things run faster.\\n\\nSeveral methods can be used to make inference cheaper in memory or/and faster in time.\\n\\nApply various parallelism to scale up the model across a large number of GPUs. Smart parallelism of model components and data makes it possible to run a model of trillions of parameters.\\nMemory offloading to offload temporarily unused data to the CPU and read them back when needed later. This helps with memory usage but causes higher latency.\\nSmart batching strategy; E.g. EffectiveTransformer packs consecutive sequences together to remove padding within one batch.\\nNetwork compression techniques, such as pruning, quantization, distillation. A model of smaller size, in terms of parameter count or bitwidth, should demand less memory and run faster.\\nImprovement specific to a target model architecture. Many architectural changes, especially those for attention layers, help with transformer decoding speed.\\n\\nCheck the previous post on large model training on different types of training parallelism and memory saving designs including CPU memory offloading. This post focuses on network compression techniques and architecture-specific improvement for transformer models.\\nDistillation#\\nKnowledge Distillation (KD; Hinton et al. 2015, Gou et al. 2020) is a straightforward way to build a smaller, cheaper model (“student model”) to speed up inference by transferring skills from a pre-trained expensive model (“teacher model”) into the student. There is no much restriction on how the student architecture should be constructed, except for a matched output space with the teacher in order to construct a proper learning objective.\\n\\n\\nThe generic framework of teacher-student knowledge distillation training. (Image source: Gou et al. 2020)\\n\\nGiven a dataset, a student model is trained to mimic outputs of a teacher via distillation loss. Usually a neural network has a softmax layer; For example, a LLM outputs a probability distribution over tokens. Let’s denote the logits layer right before softmax as $\\\\mathbf{z}_t$ and $\\\\mathbf{z}_s$ for teacher and student models, respectively. The distillation loss minimizes the difference between two softmax outputs with a high temperature $T$. When ground truth labels $\\\\mathbf{y}$ are known, we can combine it with a supervised learning objective between ground truth and the student’s soft logits using e.g. cross-entropy.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{KD} = \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{distll}(\\\\text{softmax}(\\\\mathbf{z}_t, T), \\\\text{softmax}(\\\\mathbf{z}_s, T)) + \\\\lambda\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{CE}(\\\\mathbf{y}, \\\\mathbf{z}_s)\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\lambda$ is a hyperparameter to balance between soft and hard learning objectives. A common choice for $\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{distll}$ is KL divergence / cross entropy.\\nA successful early trial is DistilBERT (Sanh et al. 2019) that is able to reduce the parameters of a BERT by 40% while maintaining 97% performance of BERT on fine-tuned downstream tasks and running 71% faster. The loss of pre-training DistilBERT is a combination of soft distillation loss, supervised training loss (i.e. Masked language modeling loss $\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{MLM}$ in the case of BERT) and a special cosine embedding loss to align the hidden state vectors between teacher and student.\\nDistillation can be easily combined with quantization, pruning or sparsification techniques, where the teacher model is the original full-precision, dense model and the student is quantized, pruned, or trimmed to have higher sparsity level.\\nQuantization#\\nThere are two common approaches for applying quantization on a deep neural network:\\n\\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ): A model is first trained to convergence and then we convert its weights to lower precision without more training. It is usually quite cheap to implement, in comparison to training.\\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT): Quantization is applied during pre-training or further fine-tuning. QAT is able to attain better performance but requires extra computation resources and access to representative training data.\\n\\nWe should be aware of the gap between theoretical optimal quantization strategy and the hardware kernel support. Due to the lack of GPU kernel support for certain types of matrix multiplication (e.g. INT4 x FP16), not all the methods below result in speedup for the actual inference.\\nChallenges for Transformer Quantization#\\nMany studies on Transformer model quantization have the same observation: A simple low-precision (e.g. 8-bit) post-training quantization leads to significant performance drop mainly due to the high dynamic ranges of activation and a naive activation quantization strategy fails to maintain the capacity.\\n\\n\\nOnly quantizing model weights to 8-bit while keeping activation at full precision (`W8A32`) achieves much better results when activations are quantized to 8-bit irrespective of whether weights are in lower precision (`W8A8` and `W32A8`). (Image source: Bondarenko et al. 2021)\\n\\nBondarenko et al. (2021) observed in a small BERT model that FFN’s input and output have very different dynamic ranges due to strong outliers in the output tensor. Therefore per-tensor quantization for the FFN’s residual sum is likely to cause a notable error.\\nAs the model size continues to grow to billions of parameters, outlier features of high magnitude start to emerge in all transformer layers, causing failure of simple low-bit quantization. Dettmers et al. (2022) observed such a phenomenon for OPT models larger than 6.7B parameters. Larger models have more layers with extreme outliers and these outlier features have a significant impact on the model performance. The scale of activation outliers in a few dimensions can be ~100× larger than most of the other values.\\n\\n\\nThe mean zero-shot accuracy over a set of language tasks (WinoGrande, HellaSwag, PIQA, LAMBADA) of OPT models of increasing sizes. (Image source: Dettmers et al. 2022)\\n\\nPost-training quantization (PTQ)#\\nMixed-precision quantization#\\nThe most straightforward approach for resolving the above quantization challenge is to implement quantization at different precision for weights vs activation.\\nGOBO (Zadeh et al. 2020) is one of the first models to apply post-training quantization on transformers (i.e. a small BERT model). It assumes that model weights of each layer follow a Gaussian distribution and therefore detects outliers by tracking mean and standard deviation per layer. Outlier features remain in original form, while other values are split into multiple bins and only corresponding bin indices of weights and the centroid values are stored.\\nBased on the observation that only certain activation layers (e.g. residual connections after FFN) in BERT cause big performance drop, Bondarenko et al. (2021) adopted mixed-precision quantization by using 16-bit quantization on problematic activations but 8-bit on others.\\nMixed-precision quantization in LLM.int8() (Dettmers et al. 2022) is implemented via two mixed-precision decompositions:\\n\\nBecause matrix multiplication contains a set of independent inner products between row and column vectors, we can impose independent quantization per inner product: Each row and column are scaled by the absolution maximum values and then quantized to INT8.\\nOutlier activation features (e.g. 20x larger than other dimensions) remain in FP16 but they represent only a tiny fraction of total weights. How to identify outliers is empirical.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo mixed-precision decompositions of `LLM.int8()`. (Image source: Dettmers et al. 2022)\\n\\nQuantization at fine-grained granularity#\\n\\n\\nComparison of quantization at different granularity. $d$ is the model size / hidden state dimension and $h$ is the number of heads in one MHSA (multi-head self-attention) component.\\n\\nNaively quantizing the entire weight matrix in one layer (“per-tensor” or “per-layer” quantization) is easiest to implement but does not lead to good granularity of quantization.\\nQ-BERT (Shen, Dong & Ye, et al. 2020) applied group-wise quantization to a fine-tuned BERT model, treating an individual matrix $W$ with respect to each head in MHSA (multi-head self-attention) as one group and then applies Hessian based mixed precision quantization.\\nPer-embedding group (PEG) activation quantization was motivated by the observation that outlier values only appear in a few out of $d$ (hidden state / model size) dimensions (Bondarenko et al. 2021). Per-embedding is pretty computationally expensive. In comparison, PEG quantization splits the activation tensor into several evenly sized groups along the embedding dimension where elements in the same group share quantization parameters. To ensure all outliers are grouped together, they apply a deterministic range-based permutation of embedding dimensions, where dimensions are sorted by their value ranges.\\nZeroQuant (Yao et al. 2022) uses group-wise quantization for weights, same as in Q-BERT, and token-wise quantization for activation. To avoid expensive quantization and de-quantization computation, ZeroQuant built customized kernel to fuse quantization operation with its previous operator.\\nSecond order information for quantization#\\nQ-BERT (Shen, Dong & Ye, et al. 2020) developed Hessian AWare Quantization (HAWQ) for its mixed-precision quantization. The motivation is that parameters with higher Hessian spectrum (i.e., larger top eigenvalues) are more sensitive to quantization and thus require higher precision. It is essentially a way to identify outliers.\\nIn another viewpoint, the problem of quantization is an optimization problem. Given a weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ and an input matrix $\\\\mathbf{X}$ , we want to find a quantized weight matrix $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{W}}$ to minimize the MSE:\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{W}}^* = {\\\\arg\\\\min}_{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{W}}} | \\\\mathbf{W}\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{W}}\\\\mathbf{X}|\\n$$\\nGPTQ (Frantar et al. 2022) treats the weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ as a collection of row vectors ${\\\\mathbf{w}}$ and applies quantization to each row independently. GPTQ iteratively quantizes more weights that are selected greedily to minimize the quantization error. The update on selected weights has a closed-form formula, utilizing Hessian matrices. Read more details in the paper and the OBQ (Optimal Brain Quantization; Frantar & Alistarh 2022) method if interested. GPTQ can reduce the bitwidth of weights in OPT-175B down to 3 or 4 bits without much performance loss, but it only applies to model weights not activation.\\nOutlier smoothing#\\nIt is known that activations are harder to quantize than weights in transformer models. SmoothQuant (Xiao & Lin 2022) proposed a smart solution to smooth outlier features from activations to weights via mathematically equivalent transformation and then enable quantization on both weights and activations (W8A8). Because of this, SmoothQuant has better hardware efficiency than mixed-precision quantization.\\n\\n\\nSmoothQuant migrates the scale variance from activations to weights offline to reduce the difficulty of activation quantization. Both the resulting new weight and activation matrices are easy to quantize. (Image source: Xiao & Lin 2022)\\n\\nConsidering a per-channel smooth factor $\\\\mathbf{s}$, SmoothQuant scales the weights according to:\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{Y} = (\\\\mathbf{X} \\\\text{diag}(\\\\mathbf{s})^{-1}) \\\\cdot (\\\\text{diag}(\\\\mathbf{s})\\\\mathbf{W}) = \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{X}}\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{W}}\\n$$\\nThe smoothing factor can be easily fused into previous layers’ parameters offline. A hyperparameter $\\\\alpha$ controls how much we migrate the quantization difficulty from activations to weights: $\\\\mathbf{s} = \\\\max (\\\\vert \\\\mathbf{X}_j \\\\vert)^\\\\alpha  / \\\\max( \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{W}_j \\\\vert )^{1-\\\\alpha}$. The paper found that $\\\\alpha=0.5$ is a sweet spot for many LLMs in the experiments. For models with more significant outliers in activation, $\\\\alpha$ can be adjusted to be larger.\\nQuantization-aware training (QAT)#\\nQuantization-aware training fuses the quantization operation into the pre-training or fine-tuning process. It learns model weights in low-bit representation directly and leads to better performance at the cost of additional training time and computation.\\nThe most straightforward approach is to fine-tune the model after quantization on a training dataset that is the same as or representative of the pre-training dataset. The training objective can be the same as the one for pre-training (e.g. NLL/MLM in general language model training) or specific to a downstream task that we care about (e.g. Cross entropy for classification).\\nAnother approach is to consider the full-precision model as the teacher and the lower-precision model as the student, and then optimize the low-precision model with distillation loss. Distillation usually doesn’t need to use the original dataset; E.g. Wikipedia dataset is a good choice and even random tokens can give decent performance gain. The Layer-by-layer Knowledge Distillation (LKD; Yao et al. 2022) method quantizes the network layer by layer and uses its original, unquantized version as the teacher model. Given the same inputs, LKD minimizes the MSE between the multiplication with layer weights and the multiplication of quantized layer weights.\\nPruning#\\nNetwork pruning is to reduce the model size by trimming unimportant model weights or connections while the model capacity remains. It may or may not require re-training. Pruning can be unstructured or structured.\\n\\nUnstructured pruning is allowed to drop any weight or connection, so it does not retain the original network architecture. Unstructured pruning often does not work well with modern hardware and doesn’t lead to actual inference speedup.\\nStructured pruning aims to maintain the dense matrix multiplication form where some elements are zeros. They may need to follow certain pattern restrictions to work with what hardware kernel supports. Here we focus on structured pruning to achieve high sparsity in transformer models.\\n\\nA routine workflow to construct a pruned network has three steps:\\n\\nTrain a dense network until convergence;\\nPrune the network to remove unwanted structure;\\nOptionally retrain the network to recover the performance with new weights.\\n\\nThe idea of discovering a sparse structure within a dense model via network pruning while the sparse network can still maintain similar performance is motivated by Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH): A randomly initialized, dense, feed-forward network contains a pool of subnetworks and among them only a subset (a sparse network) are “winning tickets” which can achieve the optimal performance when trained in isolation.\\nHow to prune?#\\nMagnitude pruning is simplest yet quite effective pruning method - weights with smallest absolute values are trimmed. In fact, some studies (Gale et al. 2019) found that simple magnitude pruning approaches can achieve comparable or better results than complicated pruning methods, such as variational dropout (Molchanov et al. 2017) and $l_0$ regularization (Louizos et al. 2017). Magnitude pruning is simple to apply to large models and achieves reasonably consistent performance across a wide range of hyperparameters.\\nZhu & Gupta (2017) found that large sparse models were able to achieve better performance than their small but dense counterparts. They proposed Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) algorithm that increases the sparsity of a network gradually over the course of training. At each training step, weights with smallest absolute values are masked to be zeros to achieve a desired sparsity level $s$ and masked weights do not get gradient update during back-propagation. The desired sparsity level $s$ goes up with more training steps. The process of GMP is sensitive to the learning rate schedule, which should be higher than what’s used in dense network training, but not too high to prevent convergence.\\nIterative pruning (Renda et al. 2020) iterates step 2 (prune) & step 3 (retrain) multiple times: Only a small fraction of weights are pruned and the model is retrained in each iteration. The process repeats until a desired sparsity level is reached.\\nHow to retrain?#\\nThe retraining step can be simple fine-tuning using the same pre-training data or other task-specific datasets.\\nLottery Ticket Hypothesis proposed a weight rewinding retraining technique: After pruning, the unpruned weights are reinitialized back to original values earlier in the training and then retrain with the same learning rate schedule.\\nLearning rate rewinding (Renda et al. 2020) only resets the learning rate back to its early value, while the unpruned weights stay unchanged since the end of the last train stage. They observed that (1) retraining with weight rewinding outperforms retraining with fine-tuning across networks and datasets and (2) learning rate rewinding matches or outperforms weight rewinding in all tested scenarios.\\nSparsity#\\nSparsity is an effective way to scale up model capacity while keeping model inference computationally efficient. Here we consider two types of sparsity for transformers:\\n\\nSparsified dense layers, including both self-attention and FFN layers.\\nSparse model architecture; i.e. via incorporating the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) component.\\n\\nN:M Sparsity via Pruning#\\nN:M sparsity is a structured sparsity pattern that works well with modern GPU hardware optimization, in which $N$ out of every $M$ consecutive elements are zeros. For example, the sparse tensor core of Nvidia A100 GPU has support for 2:4 sparsity for faster inference (Nvidia 2020).\\n\\n\\nA matrix of 2:4 structured sparsity and its compressed representation. (Image source: Nvidia blog)\\n\\nTo sparsify a dense neural network to follow a N:M structured sparsity pattern, Nvidia (2020) suggested using the three-step routine workflow for training a pruned network: train –> prune to satisfy 2:4 sparsity –> retrain.\\nPermuting columns can provide more options in the pruning process to maintain parameters of large magnitude or to satisfy a special restriction like N:M sparsity (Pool & Yu 2021). As long as paired axes of two matrices are permuted in the same order, the results of matrix multiplication would not change. For example,\\n(1) Within the self-attention module, if the same permutation order is applied on the axis 1 of query embedding matrix $\\\\mathbf{Q}$ and the axis 0 of key embedding matrix $\\\\mathbf{K}^\\\\top$, the final result of matrix multiplication of $\\\\mathbf{Q}\\\\mathbf{K}^\\\\top$ would stay the same.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of same permutation on $\\\\mathbf{Q}$ (axis 1) and $\\\\mathbf{K}^\\\\top$ (axis 0) to keep the results of a self-attention module unchanged.\\n\\n(2) Within the FFN layer that contains two MLP layers and one ReLU non-linear layer, we can permute the first linear weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}_1$ along the axis 1 and the second linear weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}_2$ along the axis 0 in the same order.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the same permutation on $\\\\mathbf{W}_1$ (axis 1) and $\\\\mathbf{W}_2$ (axis 0) to keep the FFN layer\\'s output unchanged. For simplicity, the bias terms are skipped but the same permutation should be applied on them too.\\n\\nTo enforce N:M structured sparsity, let’s split the columns of one matrix into multiple slides of $M$ columns (named “stripe”) and we can easily observe that both the order of columns within each stripe and the order of stripes have no effect on the N:M sparsity restriction.\\nPool & Yu (2021) proposed an iterative greedy algorithm to find optimal permutation that maximizes the weight magnitude for N:M sparsity. All pairs of channels are speculatively swapped and only the swap that leads to the greatest increase in magnitude is adopted, generating a new permutation and concluding a single iteration. Greedy algorithm may only find local minima, so they introduced two techniques to escape local minima:\\n\\nBounded regressions: In practice two random channels are swapped, up to a fixed number of times. The solution search is limited to a depth of only one channel swap to keep the search space broad and shallow.\\nNarrow, deep search: Choose multiple stripes and optimize them at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlgorithm of finding the best permutation for N:M sparsity greedily and iteratively. (Image source: Pool & Yu 2021)\\n\\nThe network can achieve better performance if it was permuted before pruning, compared to pruning the network in its default channel order.\\nTo train a model with N:M sparsity from scratch, Zhou & Ma, et al. (2021) extended STE (Straight-Through Estimator; Bengio et al. 2013), which is commonly used for back-propagation update in model quantization, to work for magnitude pruning and sparse parameter update.\\nSTE computes the gradients of dense parameters wrt the pruned network $\\\\widetilde{W}$, $\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}/\\\\partial \\\\widetilde{W}$, and applies that to the dense network $W$ as an approximation:\\n$$\\nW_{t+1} \\\\gets W_t - \\\\gamma \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\widetilde{W}}\\n$$\\nThe extended version, SR-STE (Sparse-refined STE), updates the dense weights $W$ by:\\n$$\\nW_{t+1} \\\\gets W_t - \\\\gamma \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\widetilde{W}}  + \\\\lambda_W (\\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{E}} \\\\odot W_t)\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{E}}$ is the mask matrix for $\\\\widetilde{W}$ and $\\\\odot$ is element-wise multiplication. SR-STE is proposed to prevent large change in the binary mask by (1) restricting the values of weights pruned in $\\\\widetilde{W}_t$, and (2) promoting the non-pruned weights in $\\\\widetilde{W}_t$.\\n\\n\\nComparison of STE and SR-STE. $\\\\odot$ is element-wise product; $\\\\otimes$ is matrix multiplication. (Image source: Zhou & Ma, et al. 2021)\\n\\nDifferent from STE or SR-STE, the Top-KAST (Jayakumar et al. 2021) method can preserve constant sparsity throughout training in both the forward and backward-passes but does not require forward passes with dense parameters or dense gradients.\\nAt one training step $t$, Top-KAST processes as follows:\\n\\nSparse forward pass: Select a subset of parameters $A^t \\\\subset \\\\Theta$, containing top-$K$ parameters by magnitude by each layer, restricted to top $D$-proportion of weights. The parameterization $\\\\alpha^t$ at time $t$ has parameters zeroed out if it is not in $A^t$ (active weights).\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha^t_i = \\\\begin{cases}\\n\\\\theta^t_i & \\\\text{ if } i \\\\in A^t = \\\\{i \\\\mid \\\\theta^t_i \\\\in \\\\text{TopK}(\\\\theta^t, D) \\\\}\\\\\\\\ \\n0 & \\\\text{ otherwise}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\text{TopK}(\\\\theta, x)$ selected top $x$ proportion of weights from $\\\\theta$ based on magnitude.\\n\\nSparse backward pass: Then apply gradients to a larger parameter subset $B \\\\subset \\\\Theta$ where $B$ contains $(D+M)$-proportion of weights and $A \\\\subset B$. Updating a larger proportion of weights enables more effective exploration of different pruning masks, making it more likely to cause permutations in the top $D$-proportion active weights.\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Delta_{\\\\theta^t_i} = \\\\begin{cases}\\n-\\\\eta \\\\nabla_{\\\\alpha_t} \\\\mathcal{L}(y, x, \\\\alpha^t)_i & \\\\text{ if } i\\\\in  B^t = \\\\{i \\\\mid \\\\theta^t_i \\\\in \\\\text{TopK}(\\\\theta^t, D+M) \\\\} \\\\\\\\\\n0 & \\\\text{ otherwise }\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\n\\nTraining is split into two stages and the additional coordinates in the set $B \\\\setminus A$ controls how much exploration is brought in.

(Image source: Jaszczur et al. 2021)\\n\\nSparse FFN layer: Each FFN layer contains 2 MLP and one ReLU in-between. Because ReLU will introduce a lot of zeros, they implement a fixed structure on activations to enforce only 1 non-zero value in one block of $N$ elements. The sparsity pattern is dynamic, different for each token.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nY_\\\\text{sparse} &= \\\\max(0, xW_1 + b_1) \\\\odot \\\\text{Controller}(x) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{SparseFFN}(x) &= Y_\\\\text{sparse} W_2 + b_2 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Controller}(x) &= \\\\arg\\\\max(\\\\text{Reshape}(x C_1 C_2, (-1, N)))\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere each activation in $Y_\\\\text{sparse}$ corresponds to one column in $W_1$ and one row in $W_2$. The controller is implemented as a low-rank bottleneck dense layer, $C_1 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_\\\\text{model} \\\\times d_\\\\text{lowrank}}, C_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_\\\\text{lowrank} \\\\times d_\\\\text{ff}}$ and $d_\\\\text{lowrank} = d_\\\\text{model} / N$. It uses $\\\\arg\\\\max$ for inference to select which columns should be non-zero and Gumbel-softmax trick (Jang et al. 2016) during training. Because we can compute $\\\\text{Controller}(x)$ before loading FFN weight matrices, we know which columns will be zeroed out and thus choose not to load them into memory for inference speedup.\\n\\n\\n(a) Sparse FFN layer; columns in red are not loaded in memory for faster inference.

(Image source: Jaszczur et al. 2021) *Lilian\\'s side note*: Fig (a) in the illustration from the paper is actually $Y_\\\\text{sparse} = \\\\max\\\\big(0, (xW_1 + b_1) \\\\odot \\\\text{Controller}(x)\\\\big)$, but it doesn\\'t change the results. \\n\\nSparse QKV (attention) layer: In the attention layer, the dimensionality $d_\\\\text{model}$ is divided into $S$ modules, each of size $M=d_\\\\text{model} /S$. To make sure each subdivision can access any part of the embedding, Scaling Transformer introduces a multiplicative layer (i.e., a multiplication layer multiplies inputs from multiple neural network layers element-wise) which can represent arbitrary permutation but contains fewer parameters than a dense layer.\\nGiven an input vector $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_\\\\text{model}}$, the multiplicative layer outputs $y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{S \\\\times M}$:\\n\\n$$\\ny_{s,m} = \\\\sum_i x_i D_{i,s} E_{i,m}\\n\\\\quad\\\\text{where }D \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_\\\\text{model} \\\\times S}, D \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_\\\\text{model} \\\\times M}\\n$$\\n\\nThe output of the multiplicative layer is a tensor of size $\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\text{batch size}\\\\times \\\\text{length} \\\\times S \\\\times M}$. It then gets processed by a two-dimensional convolutional layer, where $\\\\text{length}$ and $S$ are treated as the height and width of an image. Such a convolution layer further reduces the parameter count and computation time of attention layer.\\n\\n\\n(a) A multiplicative layer is introduced to enable partitions to access any part of an embedding. (b) Combination of multiplicative dense layer and 2-D convolutional layer reduces the number of parameters and computation time of the attention layer. (Image source: Jaszczur et al. 2021)\\n\\nTo better work with long sequences, Scaling Transformer is further equipped with LSH (locality-sensitive hashing) attention from Reformer (Kitaev, et al. 2020) and FFN block recurrence, resulting in Terraformer.\\nMixture-of-Experts#\\nMixture-of-experts (MoE) models depend on a collection of “expert” networks and each example only activates a subset of networks to get predictions. The idea originated back to the 1990s (Jacobs et al. 1991) and is strongly related to ensemble methods. For details on how to incorporate MoE module into transformer, please check my previous post on large model training techniques and a survey paper on MoE by Fedus et al. 2022.\\nWith MoE architecture, only partial parameters are utilized at decoding time and therefore it saves inference cost. The capacity of each expert can be adjusted with a hyperparameter, capacity factor $C$, and the expert capacity is defined as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Expert capacity} = \\\\text{round}(C \\\\cdot k \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\text{total # tokens in one batch}}{\\\\text{# experts}})\\n$$\\n\\nwhere top-$k$ experts are selected per token. Larger $C$ leads to higher expert capacity and improved performance but more expensive computationally. When $C>1$, a slack capacity is added; otherwise, when $C<1$, the routing network needs to ignore some tokens.\\nRouting Strategy Improvement#\\nMoE layer has a routing network to assign a subset of experts for each input token. The routing strategy in vanilla MoE models is to route each token toward preferred experts differently as they come up in the natural order. If a token is routed to experts that have reached their capacity, the token would be marked “overflowed” and skipped.\\nV-MoE (Vision MoE; Riquelme et al. 2021) adds MoE layers into ViT (Vision Transformer). It matches the performance of previous SoTA but only requires half of inference compute. V-MoE can be scaled up to 15B parameters. Their experiments used $k=2$, 32 experts and every-2 expert placement (meaning that MoEs are placed in every other layer).\\nSince each expert has a limited capacity, some important and informative tokens may have to be discarded if they come up too late in the predefined sequence order (e.g. the order of words in a sentence, or the order of image patches). To avoid such a drawback in the vanilla routing scheme, V-MoE adopts BPR (Batch Priority Routing) to assign experts to tokens with a high priority score first. BPR computes a priority score (max or sum of top-$k$ router scores) per token before expert assignment and alters the order of tokens accordingly. This guarantees that the expert capacity buffer would be fulfilled with key tokens first.\\n\\n\\nHow image patches are discarded according to priority scores when $C < 1$. (Image source: Riquelme et al. 2021)\\n\\nBPR works much better than vanilla routing when $C\\\\leq 0.5$, where the model starts dropping a significant amount of tokens. It capacitates the model to be competitive with the dense network even at quite low capacities.\\nWhen looking into how to interpret image class-expert association, they observed that early MoE layers are more general, while later MoE layers could be specialized for a few image classes.\\nTask MoE (Task-level Mixture-of-Experts; Kudugunta et al. 2021 ) takes the task information into consideration and routes tokens at the task level instead of the word or token level for machine translation. They used MNMT (multilingual neural machine translation) as an example and group translation tasks based on the target language or language pairs.\\nToken level routing is dynamic and the routing decision for each token is made disjointly. Hence, at inference time, the server needs to preload all the experts. In comparison, task level routing is static given a fixed task, so the inference server for one task only needs to preload $k$ experts (assuming top-$k$ routing). According to their experiments, Task MoE can achieve similar performance gain as token MoE compared to dense model baseline with 2.6x higher peak throughput and 1.6% of the decoder size.\\nTask level MoE is essentially to categorize a distribution of tasks according to predefined  heuristics and incorporate such human knowledge into the router. When such heuristics do not exist (e.g. consider a general sentence continuation task), it would not be straightforward how to utilize Task MoE.\\nPR-MoE (Pyramid residual MoE; Rajbhandari et al. 2022) has each token pass one fixed MLP and one chosen expert. Due to the observation that MoE at later layers is more beneficial, PR-MoE adopts more exports at later layers. DeepSpeed library implements a flexible multi-expert, multi-data parallelism to enable training PR-MoE with different numbers of experts across layers.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of PR-MoE architecture in comparison with a standard MoE. (Image source: Rajbhandari et al. 2022)\\n\\nKernel Improvement#\\nExpert networks can be hosted on different devices. However, when the number of GPUs increases, the number of experts per GPU decreases and the communication between experts (“All-to-all”) grows to be more expensive. All-to-all communication between experts across a number of GPUs relies on P2P APIs of NCCL, which cannot saturate the bandwidth of high-speed links (e.g. NVLink, HDR InfiniBand) at a large scale, as individual chunk gets smaller with more nodes used. The existing all-to-all algorithm performs poorly at large scale with a small workload. There are a variety of kernel improvements to enable more efficient MoE computation, such as making all-to-all communication cheaper/faster.\\nBoth the DeepSpeed library (Rajbhandari et al. 2022) and TUTEL (Hwang et al. 2022) implemented a tree-based hierarchical all-to-all algorithm, which runs an intra-node all-to-all followed by an inter-node all-to-all. It reduces the communication hops from $O(G)$ to $O(G_\\\\text{node} + G / G_\\\\text{node})$, where $G$ is the total number of GPU nodes and $G_\\\\text{node}$ is the number of GPU cores per node. Although the communication volume is doubled in such implementation, it enables better scaling with small batches at large scale as the bottleneck is on latency instead of communication bandwidth when the batch size is small.\\nDynaMoE (Kossmann et al. 2022) uses dynamic recompilation to adapt the computational resources to dynamic workloads among experts. The RECOMPILE mechanism compiles the computation graph from scratch and only reallocates resources when needed. It measures how many samples are assigned to each expert and adjusts their capacity factors $C$ dynamically, in order to reduce the memory and computation requirements at run time. Based on the observation that sample-expert assignments converge early in training, sample assignment caching is introduced after convergence and then RECOMPILE is used to eliminate the dependency between the gating network and experts.\\nArchitectural Optimization#\\nThe survey paper on Efficient Transformers (Tay et al. 2020) reviewed a collection of new transformer architectures with improvement for better computational and memory efficiency. Strongly recommend a read. You can also check out my post “The Transformer Family Version 2.0” for introduction to a diverse set of transformer archiecture improvements in depth, including changes to make the model cheaper to run.\\n\\n\\nCategorization of efficient transformer models.(Image source: Tay et al. 2020)\\n\\nSince the self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexity and that is the main bottleneck for better transformer decoding efficiency, all the efficient transformer models have applied some form of sparsity to the otherwise dense attention layer. Here only lists a high-level overview, several derived from Tay et al. 2020.\\nSparse Attention Patterns#\\n\\n\\nFixed Patterns limit the field of view for the attention matrix, using predefined, fixed patterns.\\n\\nChunk input sequences into fixed blocks, such as Blockwise Attention;\\nImage Transformer uses local attention;\\nSparse Transformer uses strided attention patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\nCombined Patterns learn to sort/cluster the input tokens - enabling a more optimal global view of the sequence while maintaining the efficiency benefits of fixed patterns.\\n\\nSparse Transformer combines strided and local attention;\\nGiven a high dimensional input tensor, instead of applying attention to the flattened version of the input, Axial Transformer applies multiple attentions, each along a single axis of the input tensor.\\nETC, Longformer and Big Bird combines local and global context, as well as strided or random attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearnable Patterns identify the optimal attention pattern via learning.\\n\\nReformer clusters tokens into clusters based on hash-based similarity (LSH);\\nRouting Transformer runs $k$-means clustering on tokens;\\nSinkhorn Sorting Network learns to sort blocks of input sequence.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecurrence#\\nRecurrence mechanism connects multiple blocks/segments via recurrence.\\n\\nTransformer-XL makes use of longer context by reusing hidden states between segments.\\nUniversal Transformer combines self-attention with the recurrent mechanism in RNN.\\nCompressive Transformer is an extension of Transformer-XL with additional memory, containing a set of memory slots for past activiations and compressive memory slots for compressed activations. Whenever the model accepts a new input segment, the oldest activations in the primary memory are moved to the compressed memory where a compression function is applied.\\n\\nMemory Saving Designs#\\nMemory saving designs refer to changes of the architecture to use less memory.\\n\\nLinformer projects the length dimension of keys and values to a lower-dimensional representation ($N \\\\to k$) and thus the memory complexity is reduced from $N \\\\times N$ to $N \\\\times k$.\\nShazeer (2019) proposed multi-query attention which has the keys and values shared across different attention “heads”, greatly reducing the size of these tensors and the memory cost.\\nRandom feature attention and Performer use kernel methods to achieve a cheaper mathematical format of the self-attention mechanism.\\n\\nAdaptive Attention#\\nAdaptive attention enables the model to learn the optimal attention span or decide on when to do early exiting for different input tokens.\\n\\nAdaptive Attention Span trains the model to learn the optimal attention span per token per head via a soft mask between the token and other keys.\\nUniversal Transformer incorporates recurrent mechanism and uses ACT (Adaptive computation time) to dynamically decide the number of recurrent steps.\\nDepth-Adaptive Transformer and CALM learns when to early exit the computation layers per token using some confidence measures to achieve good performance-efficiency tradeoffs.\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian.
